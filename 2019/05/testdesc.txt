Test 1 :
	Outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.

Test 2 :
	Not sure anymore	

Test 3 :
	Using position mode, consider whether the input is 
	equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).

Test 4 : 
	Using position mode, consider whether the input is 
	less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).

Test 5 :
	Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is 
	equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).

Test 6 :
	Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is 
	less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).

Test 7 :
	Take an input, then output 0 if the input was zero 
	or 1 if the input was non-zero (Position Mode)
	
Test 8 :
	Take an input, then output 0 if the input was zero 
	or 1 if the input was non-zero (Immidiate Mode)

Test 9 :
	Uses an input instruction to ask for a single number. 
	The program will then output 999 if the input value 
	is below 8, output 1000 if the input value is equal 
	to 8, or output 1001 if the input value is greater 
	than 8.
